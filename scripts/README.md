# scripts
One-off and maintenance scripts to help us generate and adjust the data.

Run `npm i` to get node dependencies for node scripts.

Refer to each script to know whether they are one-off scripts or maintenance scripts that can be run again without harming the data. Further details below.

## one-off scripts
These scripts helped modify the data in a certain way at one point during the project. They're kept here for reference and to reproduce those changes if ever needed (e.g. on a new batch of data).

## maintenance scripts
These scripts can be run on old and new data without loss.
